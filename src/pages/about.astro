				<h2>The Mission</h2>
				<p>
					We help Filipinos build financial security through practical, honest advice that actually works on a Filipino salary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most financial advice assumes you're earning big money with no family obligations. That's not reality. We create content for people earning 25,000 to 50,000 pesos monthly who are supporting family, managing debt, and trying to build a better future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Financial literacy shouldn't be a privilege. Every Filipino deserves clear information about saving, budgeting, and managing money without the jargon or sales pitches.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="about-section">
				<h2>What We Do</h2>
				<p>
					We research, compare, and explain financial products and strategies in plain language. Digital banks, budgeting methods, debt payoff strategies, investment options - we break it all down so you can make informed decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may partner with financial brands and earn from affiliate relationships, but only with products we genuinely believe are effective and helpful. If we're earning from a recommendation, we'll tell you. Our reviews stay honest regardless of partnerships.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="about-section">
				<h2>What We Believe</h2>
				<p>
					Money isn't everything, but financial stress affects everything. Smart decisions matter more than big paychecks. Family obligations are real and valid. And you're capable of building financial security, even on a modest salary.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="about-section">
				<h2>Our Promise</h2>
				<p>
					We stay current with rates and policies. We use realistic Filipino examples and peso amounts. We admit when we don't know something. And we respect your intelligence enough to give you facts without pushing you toward any particular choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your financial future starts with the choices you make today. We're here to help you make those choices with confidence.
				</p>
				<p>Welcome to MoneyJuan.</p>
