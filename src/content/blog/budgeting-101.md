Living paycheck to paycheck is stressful. One day you have money, the next day it's gone, and you're counting the days until the 15th or 30th.

The solution isn't always "earn more" (though that helps). The first step is to **control where your money goes**.

## The 50/30/20 Rule (Pinoy Edition)

A popular way to budget is the 50/30/20 rule. It's simple and flexible.

### 50% Needs (Kailangan)
These are non-negotiables.
*   Rent / Amortization
*   Groceries
*   Utilities (Electricity, Water, Internet)
*   Transportation (Commute / Gas)

### 30% Wants (Gusto)
This is your "fun money". Yes, you need to enjoy life too!
*   Dining out / Milk tea
*   Netflix / Spotify subscriptions
*   Shopping
*   Travel fund

### 20% Savings & Debt (Ipon at Utang)
This is for your future self.
*   Emergency Fund
*   Paying off credit card debt
*   Investments (MP2, Stocks)

## How to Start

1.  **Track your spending.** For one month, write down every peso you spend. You'll be surprised how much goes to small things.
2.  **Categorize.** Group them into Needs, Wants, and Savings.
3.  **Adjust.** If your Needs are 70% of your income, you might need to cut back on Wants or find a side hustle.

Remember, a budget isn't a prison. It's a plan to make sure your hard-earned money goes to what truly matters to you.
