So you have your emergency fund (good job!) and you want to start investing. You want something safe but with better returns than a regular savings account.

Two common options are **Time Deposits** and **Pag-IBIG MP2**.

## Time Deposits (TD)

*   **What is it?** You keep your money in the bank for a fixed period (30 days to 1 year+).
*   **Return:** Usually low (1% to 4% per annum), depending on the bank. Digital banks offer higher rates.
*   **Risk:** Very low (insured by PDIC up to ₱500k).
*   **Liquidity:** You can withdraw early but with a penalty.

## Pag-IBIG MP2 (Modified Pag-IBIG 2)

*   **What is it?** A voluntary savings program by the government.
*   **Return:** Historically higher (6% to 8% per annum in recent years). *Note: Returns are not guaranteed but have been consistent.*
*   **Risk:** Very low (government-guaranteed).
*   **Lock-in:** 5 years. You can't touch the money easily.
*   **Tax-Free:** Dividends are tax-free!

## Which is Better?

*   **Choose Time Deposit (or Digital Bank Savings)** if you might need the money in less than 5 years (e.g., for a wedding next year).
*   **Choose MP2** if you want to build long-term wealth and won't touch the money for 5 years.

## How to Start MP2

You can open an MP2 account online via the Virtual Pag-IBIG website. You can deposit as little as ₱500!
