Insurance sounds boring. But it protects your family from financial disaster.

## Insurance You Need

**1. Health Insurance (HMO or PhilHealth Plus)**
Medical bills can wipe out your savings in one hospital visit.

**2. Term Life Insurance (If you have dependents)**
If you die, who will support your family?

## Insurance You Probably Don't Need (Yet)

**Whole Life or VUL (Variable Universal Life)**
Expensive and complicated. Focus on term insurance + separate investments.

## How Much Coverage?

**Health:** At least ₱100,000 coverage
**Life:** 5-10x your annual income

Start with the basics. Get fancy later.
