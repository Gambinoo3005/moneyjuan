Debt can feel like a heavy weight on your chest. But you can lift it. The key is to have a plan.

There are two main strategies to pay off debt: the **Snowball** and the **Avalanche**.

## Debt Snowball (The Psychological Win)

**How it works:**
1.  List your debts from **smallest balance to largest balance** (ignore interest rates).
2.  Pay the minimum on everything.
3.  Throw all extra money at the **smallest debt**.
4.  Once it's gone, roll that payment into the next smallest debt.

**Why it works:** You get quick wins. Seeing a debt hit ₱0 motivates you to keep going.

## Debt Avalanche (The Math Win)

**How it works:**
1.  List your debts from **highest interest rate to lowest interest rate**.
2.  Pay the minimum on everything.
3.  Throw all extra money at the **highest interest debt**.

**Why it works:** You save the most money on interest in the long run.

## Which one should you choose?

*   If you need motivation: **Snowball**.
*   If you are disciplined and want to save money: **Avalanche**.

The best strategy is the one you will actually stick to.
