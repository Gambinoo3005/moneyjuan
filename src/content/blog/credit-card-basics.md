Credit cards can be powerful tools or dangerous traps. Here's what you need to know.

## Benefits of Credit Cards

- Build credit history
- Earn rewards and cashback
- Emergency fund backup (but not your main emergency fund!)

## Risks of Credit Cards

- High interest rates (2-3% per month = 24-36% per year)
- Minimum payment trap
- Easy to overspend

## Should You Get One?

Ask yourself:
1. Can I pay the full balance every month?
2. Do I have an emergency fund already?
3. Am I disciplined with spending?

If you answered "no" to any of these, wait.
