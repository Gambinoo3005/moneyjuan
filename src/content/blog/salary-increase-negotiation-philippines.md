Asking for a raise feels uncomfortable for most people. For many Filipinos, it feels even worse because we're taught not to be demanding or appear ungrateful. You might worry about seeming entitled, damaging your relationship with your boss, or worse, being seen as someone who doesn't appreciate their job.

But here's the reality: asking for a raise is a normal part of professional growth. Companies expect employees to advocate for themselves. Your boss won't think less of you for asking, especially if you do it the right way.

The awkwardness you feel is real, but it doesn't have to stop you. With the right preparation and approach, you can ask for what you deserve without the discomfort taking over.

In this guide, you'll learn how to prepare for the conversation, what to say when you ask, and how to handle whatever response you get. We'll walk through the entire process so you can go in confident and ready.

## Before You Ask - Do Your Homework

The key to asking for a raise without feeling awkward is preparation. When you know your worth and have clear reasons for your request, the conversation becomes less about begging and more about presenting a case.

### Research Your Market Value

Find out what people in your role actually make. Use salary websites like JobStreet, LinkedIn Salary Insights, or ask trusted colleagues in similar positions at other companies. Look for roles with your job title, years of experience, and industry.

If you're earning significantly below market rate, this gives you solid ground to stand on. If you're already at market rate, you'll need to focus on your performance and contributions instead.

### Document Your Wins

Make a list of your accomplishments from the past year. Include specific projects you completed, problems you solved, money you saved the company, or revenue you generated. Use numbers whenever possible.

Examples that work: "Led the project that reduced processing time by 30%," "Brought in three new clients worth 2 million pesos in contracts," "Trained five new team members, reducing onboarding time by two weeks." Vague statements like "worked hard" or "did my best" won't cut it.

### Know Your Company's Financial Health

Timing matters. If your company just announced layoffs or budget cuts, asking for a raise will likely get a no. If the company just had a record quarter or your department exceeded goals, that's your window.

Pay attention to company announcements, quarterly results, and the general mood in leadership meetings. You want to ask when the company can actually afford to say yes.

### Understand Your Company's Raise Cycle

Some companies only give raises during annual reviews. Others have budget allocations at specific times of the year. Ask HR or your manager when raises are typically discussed.

If you ask outside the cycle, you might get a "come back in six months" response even if you deserve it. Knowing the timeline helps you plan your approach.

## Preparing What to Say

The actual conversation will be easier if you know exactly what you want to communicate. Write out your key points and practice saying them out loud.

### Set a Clear Number

Decide how much you're asking for before the meeting. Research suggests asking for a specific number rather than a range shows you've done your homework.

Base your number on market research, your performance, and what feels realistic. Asking for 15-20% might work if you're significantly underpaid or took on major new responsibilities. A 5-10% increase is more standard for regular performance-based raises.

### Prepare Your Opening

You need a clear, confident opening that gets straight to the point. Avoid apologizing or hedging.

Don't say: "I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if maybe we could possibly talk about my salary sometime if you're not too busy..."

Do say: "I'd like to discuss my compensation. I've been in this role for 18 months, and based on my contributions and market research, I believe an adjustment is warranted."

### Build Your Case

Structure your reasoning in three parts: your performance, market value, and future contributions.

Performance: "Over the past year, I've successfully managed the launch of our new product line, which generated 5 million in revenue."

Market value: "Based on salary data for similar roles in our industry, the market rate is 15-20% higher than my current compensation."

Future value: "I'm ready to take on the lead role for the upcoming expansion project, which will require managing a team of five."

### Practice Out Loud

Rehearse your pitch with a friend, family member, or even in front of a mirror. It will feel silly, but it works. The more you practice, the less nervous you'll be in the actual conversation.

Pay attention to your tone. You want to sound confident but not aggressive, professional but not robotic. Practice until it feels natural.

## Setting Up the Conversation

How you ask for the meeting matters as much as what you say in it.

### Request a Meeting Properly

Don't ambush your boss in the hallway or bring it up during your regular check-in. Send a formal request for a dedicated meeting.

Email template: "Hi [Manager's Name], I'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss my role and compensation. Would you have 30 minutes available this week or next? Please let me know what works for your schedule."

This gives your manager time to prepare and shows you're taking it seriously. It also prevents the "let me think about it" delay that happens with surprise requests.

### Choose the Right Time

Tuesday through Thursday, mid-morning or early afternoon usually works best. Avoid Monday mornings when everyone is stressed, and Friday afternoons when people are mentally checked out.

Don't schedule it right after your boss had a difficult meeting or during a company crisis. Wait for a relatively calm period.

### Pick a Private Setting

Request a closed-door meeting in a conference room or private office. Never ask for a raise in an open office space, at lunch with coworkers around, or over email.

This conversation needs privacy. It protects both your dignity and your manager's ability to respond honestly.

## During the Conversation

You've prepared. You've scheduled the meeting. Now it's time to actually ask.

### Start Strong

Walk in confident. Greet your manager normally, sit down, and get to the point within the first minute.

"Thank you for meeting with me. As I mentioned, I wanted to discuss my compensation. I've been with the company for two years, and I believe my contributions warrant a salary increase to [specific amount]."

Then pause. Let them process what you've said before you continue.

### Present Your Evidence

Walk through your prepared case calmly and clearly. Reference your list of accomplishments, market research, and increased responsibilities.

Keep it factual and professional. This isn't the time to talk about personal financial struggles, rising living costs, or what your friend at another company makes. Focus on your professional value.

### Let Them Respond

After you've made your case, stop talking. The silence might feel uncomfortable, but resist the urge to fill it with nervous chatter or backtracking.

Give your manager time to think and respond. They might need to ask questions, check budgets, or consult with HR. That's normal.

### Handle Common Responses

If they say yes: Great! Get it in writing with the new salary and effective date. Thank them professionally.

If they say no: Ask why. Listen to their reasoning. Is it budget constraints, timing, performance concerns, or company policy? Understanding the reason helps you decide your next move.

If they say maybe: Ask for specifics. "What would need to happen for this to become a yes? What timeline are we looking at?" Pin down concrete next steps and a follow-up date.

### Avoid Getting Defensive

If they bring up concerns about your performance, listen without interrupting. Don't get emotional or argumentative. Ask for specific examples and what you can do to address them.

"I appreciate that feedback. Can you give me specific examples so I understand what needs to improve? I want to make sure I'm meeting expectations."

## After the Conversation

What happens after you ask is just as important as the ask itself.

### If You Got the Raise

Get everything in writing. Confirm the new salary amount, effective date, and whether it's a one-time increase or affects your base going forward.

Send a thank-you email reiterating your commitment to the company and your goals for the coming year. This reinforces that you earned it.

### If You Didn't Get It

Ask for clear feedback and a concrete plan. "What specific goals or metrics do I need to hit to revisit this conversation in three months?"

Document this conversation. Send a follow-up email summarizing what was discussed and the agreed-upon timeline for reassessment.

### Decide Your Next Move

If the answer is no because of budget, and you believe them, decide if you can wait for the timeline they gave you. If they said six months, mark your calendar and prepare to ask again.

If the answer is no because they don't value your work, start exploring other opportunities. You don't have to quit immediately, but begin looking at what else is out there.

If they gave you a smaller increase than you asked for, decide if it's enough or if you want to negotiate further. Sometimes a compromise is better than nothing.

### Keep Performing

Whether you got the raise or not, maintain your work quality. Don't let resentment affect your performance. If you're staying, stay professional. If you're leaving, leave on good terms.

The professional world is small. How you handle this situation will follow you.

## What If You're Still Too Nervous

Even with all this preparation, you might still feel too anxious to ask. That's okay. Here are some strategies to push through.

### Remember It's Business

Your relationship with your employer is fundamentally a business transaction. You provide value, they compensate you for it. Renegotiating that compensation is normal business practice.

They're not doing you a favor by employing you. You're not being greedy by asking for fair pay. This is how the system works.

### Write It Down First

If speaking feels too intimidating, write out your request as an email or letter first. You can use it to organize your thoughts, and if needed, you can actually send it to request the meeting.

Some people find that putting it in writing first makes the verbal conversation easier because they've already "said" it once.

### Bring Notes

It's completely acceptable to bring notes to this meeting. Having your accomplishments and key points written down means you won't forget anything important, even if you get nervous.

"I wrote down some key points I wanted to make sure I covered" is a perfectly professional thing to say.

### Practice with Someone

Role-play the conversation with someone you trust. Have them play your manager and ask you tough questions. The more you practice handling objections and staying calm, the easier the real thing becomes.

## Moving Forward

Asking for a raise gets easier each time you do it. The first time is the hardest because you're fighting years of conditioning that says asking for yourself is wrong.

It's not wrong. It's necessary. Your career growth depends on your ability to advocate for yourself because no one else will do it for you.

If you don't ask, the answer is always no. But if you do ask, prepared and professional, you've got a real chance at yes. Even if this attempt doesn't work out, you've practiced a crucial skill you'll use throughout your career.

Every successful professional has asked for raises, negotiated salaries, and advocated for their worth. You can too.
